# - 33 mosquitos facts: ://www.megacatch.com/mosquitofacts.html
#   > They are cold-blooded and prefer temperatures over 80 degrees. At temperatures less than 50 degrees, they shut down for the winter
#   > Mosquitoes spend their first 10 days in water
#   > Usually, the eggs are deposited in clusters - called rafts - on the surface of stagnant water, or they are laid in areas that flood regularly.
#   > The average mosquito lifespan is less than two months. Males have the shortest lives, usually 10 days or less, and females can live about six to eight weeks, under ideal conditions
#   > Mosquitoes cant fly very far or very fast. Most mosquitoes can fly no more than about one to three miles, and often stay within several hundred feet of where they were hatched
#   > Body heat marks the target. Mosquitoes use heat sensors around their mouthparts to detect the warmth of your body
#   > West Nile virus came to the U.S. in 1999 with an epidemic in New York
#

# - CDC: http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/faq/genQuestions.html
#   > The weather, numbers of birds that maintain the virus, numbers of mosquitoes that spread the virus, and human behavior are all factors that can influence when and where outbreaks occur
